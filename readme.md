# Supermarket Web Scrapper

## Setting up

```
npm install
node app.js <search term>
```

## Future Upgrades

- Use a proper headless browser
- Imitate a proper user-agent
- Combine scrape and search
- Add on-clicks

## Week2 Branch Update

- Only works with "node app butter chicken" (due to classes names being different)
- Does not work with any other products
- It knows to click on the first product that loads on the page
